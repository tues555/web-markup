            My name is Ties and i’m an 18 year old student and I’m from (you’ll never guess where) Amsterdam! 
            I grew up in the middle  of the city, which is the most diverse city in the world. 
            As per 2010, the city counted 178 different nationalities! 
            Growing up in a big mix of cultures from all around the world,
            by going to english speaking schools made me realise Amsterdam takes a while getting used to, 
            since its dofferent from anywhere else! thats whyI made the sac, 
            to help newcomers get settled in and get used to the special city quicker. 
            During the making of this website, 
            I also did research by interviewing friends / family with a form, 
            asking them about their opiions / favorite spots in amsterdam. 
            This will be concluded in the categories section.
