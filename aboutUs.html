          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
As you may already know, my name is Ties. I’m an 18-year-old student studying (International) IT at InHolland. Even though my school is in Haarlem, I was born and raised in Amsterdam. By living here my entire life, I know all of the best hangout spots in the city.

  <h2>Why did I create S.A.C?</h2>
<p>    
Because I study in an international class and graduated from an international high school, I do have a sense of what it’s like to arrive here as a newcomer. Growing up, I had lots of friends who were new to the city, and I always made it my goal to show them around.
That experience inspired me to create this website. My goal is simple: to help every student discover the beautiful parts of this city —whether you’re here just for a semester or planning to stay longer.
