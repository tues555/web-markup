          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            As you may already know, my name is Ties. I’m an 18-year-old student
            studying (International) IT at InHolland. Even though my school is
            in Haarlem, I was born and raised in Amsterdam. By living here my
            entire life, I know all of the best hangout spots in the city.

          <h2>Why did I create S.A.C?</h2>
          <p>
            Because I study in an international class and graduated from an
            international high school, I do have a sense of what it’s like to
            arrive here as a newcomer. Growing up, I had lots of friends who
            were new to the city, and I always made it my goal to show them
            around. That experience inspired me to create this website. My goal
            is simple: to help every student discover the beautiful parts of
            this city —whether you’re here just for a semester or planning to
            stay longer.
