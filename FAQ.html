<h2>Why did you create SAC?</h2>
<p>
  What orginially started as a project for school, 
  quickly became something I actually wanted to do for people outside of school too! 
  Since I also have a very international class, 
  I hope my classmates can use this webpage to get to know the capital of the Netherlands!

    <section class="FAQBOX2">
<h2>Are there a lot of entry fees?</h2>
<p>
  Since this website is mainly created for the use of students, 
  i’ve kept the pricing in my mind ofcourse. Most places don’t have a entry fee, 
  except for some of the daytrips. Make sure to always bring your student id, 
  so you’ll get an additional discount.  
  This way, these daytrip places are still going to be affordable for a student, 
  so don’t you worry!

<h2>Is it just for students?</h2>
<p>
  No it’s not just for students. Eventhough it’s called “Student activity center”, 
  you can still make use of it after your study, or if your not a student at all. 
  We’re just based on student-focused categories.

<h2>How do I know where to go? </h2>
<p>
  Fortunately, Amsterdam is very easily guidable with google maps. 
  This is why, on my maps page, I’ve linked every place metioned to the corresponding location on google maps, 
  so it’s still easy to find for you!
