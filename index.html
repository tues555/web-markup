Whether ur a newcoming student who is new to the city somewhere from the country, or from the other side of the world: You will have to get used to all these bikers zooming around you at lightning speed, people being very direct to you and lots and lots of rain. To get to know Amsterdam, its always nice to know some fun activities around the city or get to know some of the best hangout spots. Thats why we made the S.A.C, short for the Student Activity Center.

On this website, I’ll make sure to discuss the best activities available for students in Amsterdam. So, if u are a newcomers, I highly recommend taking a look at our page. 

My website is divided under a couple of important sections: 


<br><br><strong>About us:   </strong> The page where we will tell about our backstory, the reason this website was created and how we’ve progressed and did research about this subject.
<br><br><strong>Categories: </strong> We’ve got a couple of categories as for the activities: Nightlife, Green zones, Hidden gems and Best Attractions.                                           
<br><br><strong>Maps:       </strong> On the maps page we’ll highlight the four biggest parts in Amsterdam; North, East, South and West.                                                
<br><br><strong>FAQ:        </strong> Here we will answer the most commonly asked questions, with answers provided beforehand.                                                          
<br><br><strong>Contact Us: </strong> If u have any important / urgent questions or just want someone to speak to? Make sure to hit us up on the contact page.
