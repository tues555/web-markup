          <h2>Welcome to S.A.C!</h2>
<p>
<br>Hi there! I’m Ties, and I’m excited  to introduce you to my website: the S.A.C - short for Student Activity Center. Whether you just moved here, or if you have been around for a while, this website is of great use to get yourself used to a new chapter:  student life in Amsterdam.  <br>

  <h2>A new city:</h2>
<p>    
  <br>With over 177 different nationalities (as of 2010) living in Amsterdam, it can be a bit of a culture shock for some people when they first arrive. Bikes flying past you at high speeds, people being relentlessly honest and hearing the most innovative, multi-lingual insults thrown at you - It  can all feel a little overwhelming. <br>
  <br>That’s exactly why I’ve created S.A.C. This website helps you settling in faster by finding all the local hotspots, great bars where you can meet new (Dutch) friends, and help you find peace of mind in the most underrated green zones in Amsterdam.  <br>
