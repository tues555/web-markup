          <h2>How are the categories divided?</h2>
<p>
This page is built on personal favorites and real student input —gathered through a forms I ran among fellow locals. It’s not just a list of trendy TikTok spots but a selection of the actual best places in Amsterdam, rated highly by students who live here.

I’ve divided the page into four main categories —the ones that matter most when you want to enjoy the student lifestyle in this city:

<br>• Nightlife<br>• Green zones<br>• Hidden gems<br>• Day trips <br>

</p>
        </section>

        <section class="textCategories2">
          <h2>Nightlife</h2>
<p>
<br> As a student, going out at night is a big part of your study. That’s why this is the first category shown: The places mentioned are divided under 2 sub-categories. <br>

<br> Bars → More conversational and making new friends focused. <br>
<br> Nightclubs  → More dancing and party music focused <br>

</p>
        </section>


        <section class="textCategories3">
          <h2>Green zones</h2>
<p>
Sometimes all you want is to get away from all those bikes and loud people or just want to take some time to relax and come to peace of mind. These so-called ‘green zones’ (nature spots, not coffee shops) are the best way to do so. From walks to picnics or just some fresh air, these places have what you need.

        <section class="textCategories4">
          <h2>Indoor hidden gems</h2>
<p>

<br> As you might (or should) already know, Amsterdam weather can get pretty rainy. And since the green zones are outdoors, you might not always feel like studying at home, or maybe you just want a good cup of coffee somewhere cozy. <br>

<br> That’s where these local favorites come in handy. <br>

        <section class="textCategories5">
          <h2>Best atracttions</h2>
<p>

<br> Even as a local, I sometimes want to experience the classic tourist spots. Sure, some of them are overrated, but the ones I’ve listed here? They’re actually worth your time and money. <br>
<br> Whether you're showing friends around, looking for a weekend plan, or just curious about what makes Amsterdam famous, these picks give you the best version of the tourist experience, without the tourist traps. <br>
